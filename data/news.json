And, although it's near the sunrise glare now, you can still see Venus (barely) in early September. Regulus is the brightest star in the constellation Leo. It's fainter than Venus. But, as Venus sinks closer to the sunrise, Regulus ascends out of it. The 2 pass on September 5, 2022. Just before sunrise in early September, 2022, you can still find Venus very low in the east before sunrise. It'll appear near the star Regulus in Leo the Lion around September 4, 5 and 6.",

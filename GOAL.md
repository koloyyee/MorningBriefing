newscatcher: <https://rapidapi.com/newscatcher-api-newscatcher-api-default/api/newscatcher/>
open weather api: <https://openweathermap.org/guide>

The is the daily updates app I will using for my morning reading routine.
The original one had bugs that scrapes with BeautifulSoup,
so at this phase I would like to practice using APIs to show news article according to the clients liking.

I will be using newscatcher api and open weather api for data support.

This project not only give me a training with using React and focus on UI/UX,
also understanding and using an API.

This page also need to feature the followings:

1. Routing - separate into different topics.
2. Search with javascript filter function
3. Ask user for local or find user local to show local news
4. Implementing testing with Jest
5. Using Lazy loading the news

TODO:
[] - Get user location.
[] - Create news cards
[] - Fetch data within the component using useState, useEffect
[] - Create search bar for clients to search title. 
[] - Filter news by topic 
[] - Lazy loading news cards
[] - Deploy on github page and alias to my domain

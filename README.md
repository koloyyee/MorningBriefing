# Start my day with Morning Briefing

### Why?

Morning Briefing is an app for my morning reading routine,
every morning I will read some financial news to start my day,
but rather than going to 4-5 sites to find the news I want to read,
having a person new aggregator seems to be a great challenge and fun project to work on.

### Challenges

#### Types

Since I am using Typescript there are lots of interfaces and types I need to declare,
and I start to understand how to declare types and shapes for different data and have a correct interface for each.

#### CSS

I choose not to use any CSS library, but only a bit of help from MUI,
I also take the chance to practice CSS Grid, it is one of the great challenges for me,
and part of the reason why I decided not to use any CSS library but grasping the fundamental knowledge is the most important.

#### API

Since the API is freemium version, there are numbers of endpoints I can use, currently fetching the latest headlines, while moving forward I will allow users to fetch different data with different query.

#### Pagination

My original plan was to use infinite scroll, however, due to the limitation of the endpoint I decided to use pagination to separate 100 articles into numbers of pages.

### Data Source

Currently, this is an app based on fetching data from public API,
and moving forward there will be a custom backend for fetching my personal choice of news sources.
